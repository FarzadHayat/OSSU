;
; PROBLEM A:
;
; You are designing a program to track a rocket's journey as it descends
; 100 kilometers to Earth. You are only interested in the descent from
; 100 kilometers to touchdown. Once the rocket has landed it is done.
;
; Design a data definition to represent the rocket's remaining descent.
; Call it RocketDescent.
;


;; =================
;; Functions:

; PROBLEM B:
;
; Design a function that will output the rocket's remaining descent distance
; in a short string that can be broadcast on Twitter.
; When the descent is over, the message should be "The rocket has landed!".
; Call your function rocket-descent-to-msg.
