; PROBLEM:
;
; Imagine that you are designing a program to manage ticket sales for a
; theatre. (Also imagine that the theatre is perfectly rectangular in shape!)
;
; Design a data definition to represent a seat number in a row, where each
; row has 32 seats. (Just the seat number, not the row number.)
