; PROBLEM:
;
; You might want to create boxes of different colours.
;
; Use the How to Design Functions (HtDF) recipe to design a function that consumes a color, and creates a
; solid 10x10 square of that colour.  Follow the HtDF recipe and leave behind commented out versions of
; the stub and template.
