; PROBLEM:
;
; Your friend has just given you a new pad, and it runs a prototype version of Racket.
;
; This is great, you can make it do anything. There's just one problem, this version of
; racket doesn't include numbers as primitive data. There just are no numbers in it!
;
; But you need natural numbers to write your next program.
;
; No problem you say, because you remember the well-formed self-referential data definition
; for Natural, as well as the idea that add1 is kind of like cons, and sub1 is kind of like
; rest. Your idea is to make add1 actually be cons, and sub1 actually be rest...
