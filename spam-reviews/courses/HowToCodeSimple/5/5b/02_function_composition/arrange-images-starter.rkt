;
; PROBLEM:
;
; In this problem imagine you have a bunch of pictures that you would like to
; store as data and present in different ways. We'll do a simple version of that
; here, and set the stage for a more elaborate version later.
;
; (A) Design a data definition to represent an arbitrary number of images.
;
; (B) Design a function called arrange-images that consumes an arbitrary number
;     of images and lays them out left-to-right in increasing order of size.
