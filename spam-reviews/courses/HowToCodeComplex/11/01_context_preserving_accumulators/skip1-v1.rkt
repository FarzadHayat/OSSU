; PROBLEM:
;
; Design a function that consumes a list of elements and produces the list
; consisting of only the 1st, 3rd, 5th and so on elements of its input.
;
;    (skip1 (list "a" "b" "c" "d")) should produce (list "a" "c")

;; produce list consisting on only the 1st, 3rd, 5th... elements of lox
