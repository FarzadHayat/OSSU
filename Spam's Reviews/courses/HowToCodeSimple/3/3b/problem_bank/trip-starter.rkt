;; Data definitions:

;
; PROBLEM A:
;
; Design a data definition to help travellers plan their next trip.
; A trip should specify an origin, destination, mode of transport and
; duration (in days).

;; Functions:

;
; PROBLEM B:
;
; You have just found out that you have to use all your days off work
; on your next vacation before they expire at the end of the year.
; Comparing two options for a trip, you want to take the one that
; lasts the longest. Design a function that compares two trips and
; returns the trip with the longest duration.
;
; Note that the rule for templating a function that consumes two
; compound data parameters is for the template to include all
; the selectors for both parameters.
