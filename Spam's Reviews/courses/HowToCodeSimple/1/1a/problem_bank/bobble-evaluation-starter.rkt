; PROBLEM:
;
; Given the following function definition:
;
; (define (bobble s)
;   (if (<= (string-length s) 6)
;       (string-append s "ible")
;       s))
;
; Write out the step-by-step evaluation of the expression:
;
; (bobble (substring "fungus" 0 4))
;
; Be sure to show every intermediate evaluation step (including the original expression
; and the final result, our answer has 7 steps).
