## Course Description

Haskell is a high-level, purely functional programming language with a strong static type system and elegant mathematical underpinnings. It is being increasingly used in industry by organizations such as Facebook,  AT&T, and NASA, along with several financial firms. We will explore  the joys of functional programming, using Haskell as a vehicle. In the  first part of the course, you will learn to use Haskell to easily and  conveniently write practical programs. The last couple of weeks will  consist of several special topics that explore advanced features of  Haskell. Evaluation will be based on class participation, weekly  programming assignments, and an open-ended final project.
