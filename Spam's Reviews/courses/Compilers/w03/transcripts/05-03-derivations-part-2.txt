So to summarize, we're not just interested in whether a string is in
the language of a particular context-free grammar, we need to have a Parse Tree for
that string. And, a derivation defines a Parse Tree but it turns out that one Parse
Tree in general has many derivations and in particular, we're interested in the
leftmost and rightmost derivations. These are the two kinds of derivations that are
important in parser implementations.
