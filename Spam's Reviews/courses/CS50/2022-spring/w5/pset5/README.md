Collaboration on problem sets is not permitted except to the extent that you may ask  classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to  another doing your work for you, per the course’s policy on [academic honesty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/syllabus/#academic-honesty).

## [Advice](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/psets/5/#advice)

- Try out any of David’s programs from [Week 5](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/weeks/5/).

- If you see any errors when compiling your code with `make`, focus first on fixing the very first error you see, scrolling up as needed. If unsure what it means, try asking `help50` for help. For instance, if trying to compile `hello`, and

  ```bash
  make speller
  ```

  is yielding errors, try running

  ```bash
  help50 make speller
  ```

  instead!
