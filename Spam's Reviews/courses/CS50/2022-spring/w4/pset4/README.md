# [Problem Set 4](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/psets/4/#problem-set-4)

Collaboration on problem sets is not permitted except to the extent that you may ask  classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to  another doing your work for you, per the course’s policy on [academic honesty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/syllabus/#academic-honesty).



## [What to Do](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/psets/4/#what-to-do)

1. Log into [code.cs50.io](https://code.cs50.io) using your GitHub account
2. Run `update50` in your codespace’s terminal window to ensure your codespace is up-to-date and, when prompted, click **Rebuild now**
3. Submit one of:    
   - [this version of Filter](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/psets/4/filter/less/) if feeling less comfortable
   - [this version of Filter](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/psets/4/filter/more/) if feeling more comfortable
4. Submit [Recover](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/psets/4/recover/)
5. Submit [this form](https://forms.cs50.io/62652507-c335-4e6c-aac5-d55dd4e06cd5).

## [Advice](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/psets/4/#advice)

- Try out any of David’s programs from [Week 4](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/weeks/4/).

- If you see any errors when compiling your code with 

  ```bash
  make
  ```

  , focus first on fixing the very first error you see, scrolling up as needed. If unsure what it means, try asking 

  ```bash
  help50
  ```

   for help. For instance, if trying to compile 

  ```bash
  hello
  ```

  , and    

  ```bash
  make filter
  ```

  is yielding errors, try running

  ```bash
  help50 make filter
  ```

  instead!
