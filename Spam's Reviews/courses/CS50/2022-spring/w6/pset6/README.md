# [Problem Set 6](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/psets/6/#problem-set-6)

Collaboration on problem sets is not permitted except to the extent that you may ask  classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to  another doing your work for you, per the course’s policy on [academic honesty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/syllabus/#academic-honesty).

## [What to Do](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/psets/6/#what-to-do)

1. Log into [code.cs50.io](https://code.cs50.io) using your GitHub account
2. Run `update50` in your codespace’s terminal window to ensure your codespace is up-to-date.
3. Submit [Hello](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/psets/6/hello/) in Python
4. Submit one of:    
   - [this version of Mario](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/psets/6/mario/less/) in Python, if feeling less comfortable
   - [this version of Mario](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/psets/6/mario/more/) in Python, if feeling more comfortable
5. Submit one of:    
   - [Cash](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/psets/6/cash/) in Python, if feeling less comfortable
   - [Credit](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/psets/6/credit/) in Python, if feeling more comfortable
6. Submit [Readability](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/psets/6/readability/) in Python
7. Submit [DNA](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/psets/6/dna/) in Python
8. Submit [this form](https://forms.cs50.io/f79d000c-8dbb-438d-a4cf-c44b414a0aa4).

If you submit both versions of Mario, we’ll record the higher of your two scores. If you submit both Cash and Credit, we’ll record the higher of your two scores.

## [Advice](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/psets/6/#advice)

- Try out any of David’s programs from [Week 6](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/weeks/6/).

## [Academic Honesty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/psets/6/#academic-honesty)

- For Hello, Mario, Cash, Credit, and Readability, it is **reasonable** to look at your own implementations thereof in C and others’ implementations thereof *in C*.
- It is **not reasonable** to look at others’ implementations of the same *in Python*.
- Insofar as a goal of these problems is to teach you how to teach yourself a new language, keep in mind that these acts are not only reasonable, per the syllabus, but encouraged toward that end:    
  - Incorporating a few lines of code that you find online or elsewhere into your own  code, provided that those lines are not themselves solutions to assigned problems and that you cite the lines’ origins.
  - Turning to the web or elsewhere for instruction beyond the course’s own, for  references, and for solutions to technical difficulties, but not for  outright solutions to problem set’s problems or your own final project.
