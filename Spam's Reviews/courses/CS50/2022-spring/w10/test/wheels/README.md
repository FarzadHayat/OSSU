# [Reinventing Some Wheels](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/test/wheels/#reinventing-some-wheels)

A common practice in industry is [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), whereby you write tests for code before you write the code itself. The  tests themselves should be simple enough that they donâ€™t need their own  tests. For instance, a test might call some function one or more times,  each time with different arguments, testing that the return values are  expected. Letâ€™s do just that.

Suppose that youâ€™ve forgotten about [`ctype.h`](https://manual.cs50.io/#ctype.h) and so youâ€™ve decided to implement your own versions of `isalpha`, `isdigit`, and `isalnum` as well as another function of your own, `areupper`. Youâ€™ve already declared prototypes for them in `wheels/ctype.h`, and youâ€™ve even started to implement them in `wheels/ctype.c` but mostly in comments, temporarily returning `false` from most of them (so that the file will at least compile). You have, though, implemented `isalpha` already.

In `wheels/check50.c`, meanwhile, youâ€™ve written a simplified implementation of `check50`. Notice how it calls `test_isalpha`, `test_isdigit`, `test_isalnum`, and `test_areupper`, all of which are declared in `tests.h`, and then, if all four of those functions work as expected, prints a single smiley face. Only one of those functions, `test_isalpha`, is actually implemented at the moment in `wheels/tests.c`. As you might expect, it tests `isalpha`, calling the function multiple times with different arguments, testing with `assert` that the return values are as expected. Per its [manual page](https://manual.cs50.io/3/assert), if the input to `assert` is an expression that evaluates to `false`, `assert` will print an error message and abort the program (i.e., `check50`) immediately. If, though, the input to `assert` is an expression that evaluates to `true`, `assert` will do nothing, allowing execution continue.

Letâ€™s test your (well, our) implementation of `isalpha`. In `wheels/`, execute

```
make check50
```

in order to compile the simplified version of `check50` and, with it, `ctype.c` and `tests.c`. Then execute `check50` and, with it, `test_isalpha`, with:

```
./check50
```

You should see a smiley face, because `isalpha` is not only implemented, it also passes all of the tests in `test_isalpha`!

Letâ€™s implement the rest of the tests and the functions they test!

1. (5 points.) Complete the implementation of `test_isdigit` in `wheels/tests.c` in such a way that it tests `isdigit`, calling `assert` at least three times, each time with a different argument, testing that the functionâ€™s return value is as expected. Then, complete the  implementation of `isdigit` itself, running `check50` thereafter to ensure that you still see a smiley.

1. (5 points.) Complete the implementation of `test_isalnum` in `wheels/tests.c` in such a way that it tests `isalnum`, calling `assert` at least three times, each time with a different argument, testing that the functionâ€™s return value is as expected. Then, complete the  implementation of `isalnum` itself, running `check50` thereafter to ensure that you still see a smiley.

1. (5 points.) Complete the implementation of `test_areupper` in `wheels/tests.c` in such a way that it tests `areupper`, calling `assert` at least three times, each time with a different argument, testing that the functionâ€™s return value is as expected. Then, complete the  implementation of `areupper` itself, running `check50` thereafter to ensure that you still see a smiley.

Just keep in mind that that a smiley face means that your functions  have passed all of your tests, but it doesnâ€™t mean that all of your  tests are correct!
