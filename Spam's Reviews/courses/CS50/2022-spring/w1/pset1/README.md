# [Problem Set 1](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/psets/1/#problem-set-1)

Collaboration on problem sets is not permitted except to the extent that you may ask  classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to  another doing your work for you, per the course’s policy on [academic honesty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/syllabus/#academic-honesty).

## [What to Do](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/psets/1/#what-to-do)

1. Log into [code.cs50.io](https://code.cs50.io/) using your GitHub account and follow the on-screen instructions to set up your very own “codespace” for Visual Studio Code
2. Once your codespace has loaded, close any **Welcome** tabs that might have opened by default
3. In Codespace’s terminal, complete the steps under **SSH** at [cs50.readthedocs.io/github/#ssh](https://cs50.readthedocs.io/github/#ssh) to configure your codespace for some of CS50’s command-line tools
4. Log into [submit.cs50.io](https://submit.cs50.io) using your GitHub account and click **Authorize** to activate check50.
5. Run `update50` in your codespace’s terminal window to ensure your codespace is up-to-date and, when prompted, click **Rebuild now**
6. Submit [Hello](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/psets/1/hello/)
7. Submit one of:    
   - [this version of Mario](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/psets/1/mario/less/) if feeling less comfortable
   - [this version of Mario](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/psets/1/mario/more/) if feeling more comfortable
8. Submit one of:    
   - [Cash](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/psets/1/cash/) if feeling less comfortable
   - [Credit](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/psets/1/credit/) if feeling more comfortable
9. Submit [this form](https://forms.cs50.io/da130add-948c-4b2d-abaa-e9ed3137c952).

If you submit both versions of Mario, we’ll record the higher of your two scores. If you submit both Cash and Credit, we’ll record the higher of your two scores.

## [Advice](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/psets/1/#advice)

- Try out any of David’s programs from class via [Week 1](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/weeks/1/)’s source code.

- See CS50’s [style guide for C](https://cs50.readthedocs.io/style/c/) for tips on how to improve your code’s style.

- If you see any errors when compiling your code with 

  ```bash
  make
  ```
  
  , focus first on fixing the very first error you see, scrolling up as needed. If unsure what it means, try asking 

  ```bash
  help50
  ```
  
   for help. For instance, if trying to compile 

  ```bash
  hello
  ```
  
  , and    

  ```bash
  make hello
  ```
  
  is yielding errors, try running

  ```bash
  help50 make hello
  ```
  
  instead!
