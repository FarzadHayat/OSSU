# [Problem Set 2](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/psets/2/#problem-set-2)

Collaboration on problem sets is not permitted except to the extent that you may ask  classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to  another doing your work for you, per the course’s policy on [academic honesty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/syllabus/#academic-honesty).



## [What to Do](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/psets/2/#what-to-do)

1. Log into [code.cs50.io](https://code.cs50.io) using your GitHub account
2. Run `update50` in your codespace’s terminal window to ensure your codespace is up-to-date and, when prompted, click **Rebuild now**
3. Submit [Readability](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/psets/2/readability/)
4. Submit one of:    
   - [Caesar](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/psets/2/caesar/), if feeling less comfortable
   - [Substitution](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/psets/2/substitution/), if feeling more comfortable
   - [Wordle50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/psets/2/wordle50/), if feeling more comfortable
5. Submit [this form](https://forms.cs50.io/eae8ab26-826a-46fd-a1fe-dde3671a2b1b).

You may submit more than one of Caesar, Substitution, or Wordle50.  We’ll record the single highest of your scores among those problems.

## [Advice](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/psets/2/#advice)

- Try out any of David’s programs from class via [Week 2](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/weeks/2/)’s examples.

- To see the manual pages for C functions, visit [manual.cs50.io](https://manual.cs50.io/).

- If you see any errors when compiling your code with 

  ```bash
  make
  ```

  , focus first on fixing the very first error you see, scrolling up as needed. If unsure what it means, try asking 

  ```bash
  help50
  ```

   for help. For instance, if trying to compile 

  ```bash
  readability
  ```

  , and    

  ```bash
  make readability
  ```

  is yielding errors, try running

  ```bash
  help50 make readability
  ```

  instead!
